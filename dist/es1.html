        <p class="DropCap">Understanding requirements is essential to robust design, so
            be sure requirements are "SMART":</p>
        <p><dfn>Specific</dfn> - and clearly stated</p>
        <p><dfn>Measurable</dfn> - including units of measure</p>
        <p><dfn>Achievable</dfn> - otherwise its a waste of effort</p>
        <p><dfn>Relevant</dfn> - must reflect what customers want</p>
        <p><dfn>Time-Bound</dfn> - achievable within project timeframe</p>

        <p class="DropCap">Once requirements are understood, the methods for verification shoud be defined.
            These methods must include specific test procedures to be used,
            the units of measure, and the acceptance criteria.

        <p class="DropCap">There are several categories of testing done in product development.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <details>
                    <summary>Development Testing</summary>
                    Testing done to understand the limits of the design space. Tests should be designed so that limits
                    are reached about half the time to maximize information obtained. This way, design
                    constraints are best defined. Sample sizes and test counts need to provide a good statistical basis
                    for drawing conclusions.

            <li>
                <details>
                    <summary>Verification Testing</summary>
                    Testing done to verify that functional requiremenst are met. Test failures at this point should be
                    rare and carefully evaluated if they occur.

            <li>
                <details>
                    <summary>Reliability Testing</summary>
                    Testing done to determine and/or verify expected product life. Testing must be done to failue to be
                    sure that product strengths are well understood.
