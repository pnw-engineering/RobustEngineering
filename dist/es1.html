        <p>Understanding requirements is essential to robust design, so
            be sure requirements are "SMART":</p>
        <div class="box">
            <p><dfn>Specific</dfn> - and clearly stated</p>
            <p><dfn>Measurable</dfn> - including units of measure</p>
            <p><dfn>Achievable</dfn> - otherwise its a waste of effort</p>
            <p><dfn>Relevant</dfn> - must reflect what customers want</p>
            <p><dfn>Time-Bound</dfn> - achievable within project timeframe</p>

        <p>Once requirements are understood, the methods for verification shoud be defined.
            These methods must include specific test procedures to be used,
            the units of measure, and the acceptance criteria.

        <p>There are several categories of testing done in product development.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <details>
                    <summary>Development Testing</summary>
                    Testing done to understand the limits of the design space. To maximize information obtained
                    tests should be designed so that limits are reached about half the time. This way, design
                    constraints are best defined. Sample sizes and test counts need to provide a good statistical basis

                    Testing done to verify that functional requiremenst are met. Test failures at this point should be
                    rare and carefully evaluated if they occur.
