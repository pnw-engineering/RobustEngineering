                    Testing done to understand the limits of the design space. Tests should be
                    designed so that limits are reached about half the time to maximize information
                    obtained. This way, design constraints are best defined. Sample sizes and test counts
                    need to provide a good statistical basis for drawing conclusions.

                    at this point should be rare and carefully evaluated if they occur.

                    Small sample size can contribute to design flaw escapes due to incorrect
                    conclusions due to high Beta error. Beta error is inversly proportional to
